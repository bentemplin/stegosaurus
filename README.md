# Stegosaurus
Steganography tool to insert messages into image files. Developed solely for fun; I wouldn't trust that anything in here is bulletproof.

## File Descriptions
- `main.c`: contains the main function of the program.
- `io.c`: contains functions to facilitate reading/writing of files for the program.
- `stegosaurus.c`: functions for the steganography, encryption, and command line interface aspects of the program.

## Background Description
Stegosaurus uses steganography, the practice of hiding something inside something else, to hide messages within a JPEG image.

Look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Syntax_and_structure) for info about the JPEG syntax.
